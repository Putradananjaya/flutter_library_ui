# Mobile Interface Flutter - Library

## Introduction
The display of the mobile library application has three pages by category and one page for reading news and a login page. The category page will display a list of books offered by the app. The book reading page will contain detailed information about the book chapter. The interesting thing about the appearance of this application is the animation when opening the book to the reading page.
